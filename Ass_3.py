# Assignment: Practice with Logical Operators in Conditions



# 1. Question 1: Write a program that accepts a userâ€™s age, citizenship status, and criminal 
# record status. Determine if the user is eligible to vote. A person is eligible to vote
# if they are at least 18 years old, are a citizen of the country, and do not have a criminal
# record. Use logical operators to check all these conditions in a single statement.

'''Age=int(input("Write your age: "))
Country=input("Write you country: ")
C_Record=input("Do you have criminal record ? (yes / no): ")

print("You're eligible to vote") if Age >= 18 and Country =="pakistan" and C_Record == "no" else print("You can't vote")'''
  
 
# 2. Question 2: Create a program that takes three integers as input and determines whether 
# they can form an arithmetic progression. The numbers form an arithmetic progression if 
# the difference between consecutive numbers is the same. Use logical operators to validate
# this condition and print whether the numbers form a valid sequence.
